            <br>
            <li>You can either add cocoyam while cooking the meat so it can cook together to save time or cook the cocoyam separately.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When it has cooked properly, add 2 cups of water then add palm oil, allow to cook for about ten minutes. (Remove cocoyam and pound in a mortar or blend using a blender or a food processor)</li>

            <br>
            <li>Add your Oziza first (Oziza leaves are stronger than Oha leaves), then add your Oha leaves.</li>
